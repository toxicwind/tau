/**
 * AST novelty fingerprint — "has the shape of the ground changed?".
 *
 * The budget governor needs to know whether an action produced new knowledge
 * or merely repeated old knowledge. The honest way to answer that about
 * *code* is to look at the code's structure, not at the path that was read
 * and not at the words in the output.
 *
 * So the fingerprint is the set of structural patterns the source matches,
 * hashed. Two files with the same shape produce the same fingerprint even
 * when every identifier differs — which is the point: `export function a()`
 * and `export function b()` are the same *kind* of thing, and re-reading a
 * file in a new variable name is not progress.
 *
 * The identifier names are deliberately excluded. A fingerprint that changed
 * whenever a name changed would reward renaming.
 *
 * When the language is unknown or the grammar is missing, the fingerprint
 * falls back to a content digest: coarser, but still honest — different
 * content is different ground.
