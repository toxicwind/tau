/**
 * T15 — novelty fingerprints from the real AST engine.
 *
 * The budget governor measures novelty from fingerprints. Until now the
 * caller supplied them as strings, which meant the caller decided what
 * "new" meant — and could pass the same string twice.
 *
 * The fingerprint is derived from the *parse tree* of the code that was
 * touched: the set of ast-grep structural patterns it matches, plus the
 * shape of its top-level declarations. Two different files with the same
 * structure produce the same fingerprint (they are the same shape); the same
 * file edited into a different shape produces a different one.
 *
 * The fingerprint therefore answers: "has the *structure* of the ground
 * changed?" — which is the question "is this more investigation or the same
 * investigation again?" actually turns on.
