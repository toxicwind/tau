# @tau/tau-catalog

Model catalog for [tau](https://github.com/toxicwind/tau): bundled model database, provider discovery, model identity, classification, and equivalence.

## What's inside

| Module                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `models.json` + `models`        | Bundled model database (pricing, context windows, modalities, thinking support)                                                                                                                                                              |
| `provider-models`               | Provider catalog descriptors (`CATALOG_PROVIDERS`), per-provider model resolution rules                                                                                                                                                      |
| `discovery`                     | Runtime model discovery for OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, Ollama                                                                                                                                          |
| `compat/rules`                  | Checked-in KDL policy tree: taxonomy (classes/families/revisions), class/provider cascade rules, runtime behavior vocabulary; compiled by `bun run gen:compat` into the committed `rules.json`. Provider wire data is NOT here — it comes from `@ranch/tack` (see `compat/tack.ts`)                                                        |
| `compat`                        | The rule engine: `classifyModel` (taxonomy), `resolveModelPolicy` (cascade), behavior accessors (`api-routes`, `model-limits`, `exclude-models`, `pricing-peer`), collapse, and OpenAI/Anthropic wire builders that consume resolved records |
| `identity`                      | Mechanical id utilities: reference resolution against the bundled index, dialects, selection priority, tokenizer families                                                                                                                    |
| `model-thinking`                | Runtime thinking helpers (`getSupportedEfforts`, effort clamping/mapping, wire-id routing) over resolved model records                                                                                                                       |
| `model-manager` / `model-cache` | Runtime model registry with discovery refresh and on-disk caching                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `effort`                        | Reasoning-effort level definitions                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## models.json and rules.json are generated

Never edit `src/models.json` or `src/compat/rules.json` by hand. `models.json` is produced from upstream sources (stencil.so, provider catalog discovery, OpenCode docs) by `scripts/generate-models.ts`; `rules.json` is compiled from the KDL tree in `src/compat/rules/`. Provider wire data (base URLs, key env vars, auth schemes, `/models` adapters) is owned by `@ranch/tack` (`ranch/tack`) — tau projects it via `src/compat/tack.ts` and never duplicates it. Regenerate with:

```sh
bun run gen:compat   # src/compat/rules/**/*.kdl -> src/compat/rules.json
bun run gen:models   # upstream sources + rules -> src/models.json
```

Model- or provider-conditional policy (identity, effort ladders, wire quirks, modality/limit/pricing corrections, API routing, roster exclusions) lives in the KDL tree — see `src/compat/rules/README.md` for the grammar and axis vocabulary. TypeScript changes are only for transport mechanics: provider entries in `provider-models/descriptors.ts` (fed by `compat/tack.ts` + `compat/providers.ts`), discovery/request plumbing in `provider-models/openai-compat.ts`, and generator wiring in `scripts/generate-models.ts`. Tau-side catalog policy for tack-sourced providers (default model, kind APIs, seed rows) lives in `compat/tack.ts`; the KDL tree keeps only cascade wire-compat rules for those providers. Commit `rules.json` (and a rebaked `models.json` when values change) alongside the `.kdl` edit.

## Install

```sh
bun add @tau/tau-catalog
```

Ships TypeScript source directly (no build step); requires Bun ≥ 1.3.14.

## Cost calculation

The `models` subpath (also exported from the root) provides timestamp-aware pricing helpers:

| API                                                               | Result                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calculateCost(model, usage, timestamp?)`                         | Updates and returns `usage.cost` using `model.cost`.                                                      |
| `calculateUsageCost(cost, usage, timestamp?)`                     | Updates and returns `usage.cost` using a `ModelCost`.                                                     |
| `calculateUncachedInputCost(cost, promptInputTokens, timestamp?)` | Returns the cost of a fully uncached prompt.                                                              |
| `getTimeBasedPricingPeriod(cost, timestamp?)`                     | Returns `"peak"`, `"off-peak"`, or `undefined` without a schedule.                                        |
| `getNextTimeBasedPricingTransition(cost, timestamp?)`             | Returns the next actual peak/off-peak change strictly after the timestamp, or `undefined` if none exists. |

Timestamps are Unix milliseconds; omitted timestamps use the current time for scheduled pricing. Flat token prices are unaffected. Pricing selects the latest applicable effective rate card, then its long-context tier, then the peak/off-peak multiplier. A transition query concerns the recurring tariff, not dated rate-card changes.

`ModelCost.timeBased` is optional typed metadata (`TimeBasedCost`): `offPeakMultiplier`, `peakWindows` (UTC `weekdays`, Sunday = 0, and start-inclusive/end-exclusive `startMinute`/`endMinute`), and optional `effectiveRates`. Each effective rate is a complete `TokenCost` with an `effectiveFrom` Unix-millisecond timestamp and optional `longContext` tier, replacing the base card from that instant.

Pass the request-start timestamp when estimating request usage, then preserve the resulting monetary amounts rather than repricing history at display time. TAU does this using the assistant message timestamp; it is an estimation convention, not a claim about server billing across boundaries. Prefer monetary costs reported by a provider when available.

Schedules are materialized from the [`time-based-cost` KDL axis](src/compat/rules/README.md#time-based-pricing); this does not add a `timeBased` input field to the coding agent's `models.yml`. See [user-facing pricing behavior](../../docs/models.md#usage-costs-and-time-based-pricing) for DeepSeek rates, dates, and footer indicators.
